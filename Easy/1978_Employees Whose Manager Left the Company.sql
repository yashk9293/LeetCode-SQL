-- Employees Whose Manager Left the Company


-- Table: Employees

-- +-------------+----------+
-- | Column Name | Type     |
-- +-------------+----------+
-- | employee_id | int      |
-- | name        | varchar  |
-- | manager_id  | int      |
-- | salary      | int      |
-- +-------------+----------+
-- In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
-- This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
 

-- Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

-- Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

-- The result format is in the following example.

 

-- Example 1:

-- Input:  
-- Employees table:
-- +-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
-- | employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
-- +-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
-- | 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
-- | 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
-- | 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
-- | 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
-- | 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
-- | 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |
-- +-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
-- Output: 
-- +-------------+
-- | employee_id |
-- +-------------+
-- | 11          |
-- +-------------+



-- Solution 1
SELECT employee_id from Employees
where salary < 30000 AND manager_id is not null
and manager_id not in (select employee_id from employees)
order by employee_id;



-- Solution 2
SELECT e1.employee_id
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id
WHERE e1.salary < 30000 AND e1.manager_id is not null and e2.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY e1.employee_id;
