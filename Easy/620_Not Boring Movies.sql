-- Not Boring Movies

-- X city opened a new cinema, many people would like to go to this cinema.
-- The cinema also gives out a poster indicating the movies’ ratings and descriptions.
-- Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'.
-- Order the result by rating.

 

-- For example, table cinema:

-- +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
-- |   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
-- +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
-- |   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
-- |   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
-- |   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
-- |   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
-- |   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
-- +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
-- For the example above, the output should be:
-- +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
-- |   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
-- +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
-- |   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
-- |   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
-- +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+


-- Solution 1
Select * from Cinema
where id % 2 = 1 and description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating desc


-- Solution 2
